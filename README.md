 The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is designed to address the critical issue of identifying and preventing fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging algorithms and data analytics, the system aims to accurately detect anomalous patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. Users can install and utilize the system by following the provided instructions in the README file. The project involves training a machine learning model with a dataset of credit card transactions, utilizing features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and other relevant information. The trained model can then be used to predict potential fraud in real-time transactions. The README provides clear guidelines on installation, usage, data format, model training, evaluation metrics, and dependencies. The ultimate goal is to contribute to financial security by creating an effective tool for detecting and mitigating credit card fraud, protecting both consumers and financial institutions from potential losses.


# Problem Statement: 

"Developing an efficient Credit Card Fraud Detection system to safeguard financial transactions from unauthorized and fraudulent activities in real-time. The objective is to create a robust and adaptive solution that can accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, ensuring the security and trust of credit card users. The system should leverage advanced machine learning algorithms and anomaly detection techniques to analyze transaction patterns, user behavior, and other relevant features to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The solution should be scalable, capable of handling a large volume of transactions, and should continuously evolve to adapt to new fraud patterns and techniques employed by malicious actors in the dynamic landscape of financial cyber threats."
